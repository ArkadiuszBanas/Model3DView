With *Model3DView* you can effortlessly display 3D models in your SwiftUI just like you would with images. Additionally you can manipulate the camera and transform the model, all while keeping things SwiftUI-friendly.

‚ö†Ô∏è ***IMPORTANT***: *Model3DView* is still in very early stages of development. The API is not final and ~~may~~ will change over the course of upcoming version releases.

## Features ‚ú®

## Quickstart üöÄ
The code is provided with ample documentation. For detailed information about views, methods, etc, please see inquire Xcode's documentation features. Below a quick rundown of *Model3DView*'s features.

Using *Model3DView* couldn't possibly be more easy. Use `Model3DView` like any other view:
```swift
struct MyView: View {
	var body: some View {
		Model3DView(named: "duck.gltf")
	}
}
```
This renders a 3D model with the filename "*duck.gltf*" that's located in the app's bundle.

### `Model3DView`

#### Transform
#### `onLoad` handler

### Cameras

### Interactive cameras

### Skyboxes and IBL (image based lighting)

## FAQ ‚ÑπÔ∏è
### Can I use this to make 3D games?
***No***. It is very important to understand *Model3DView* is made to only render 3D models in your SwiftUI app, with very limited interaction. It acts as an ImageView, but for 3D models.

### Why use *Model3DView* instead of *SceneView*?**  
*SceneView* (included with SwiftUI) is very limited in its nature. It simply wraps a `SKSceneView` for SwiftUI. But due to it being closed source gives no control on this view. For instance: giving the view a transparent background is practically impossible. 

*Model3DView* also provides a workflow more inline with SwiftUI's; using view modifiers to manipulate the model and camera.
