With *Model3DView* you can effortlessly display 3D models in your SwiftUI just like you would with images. Additionally you can manipulate the camera and transform the model, all while keeping things SwiftUI-friendly.

‚ö†Ô∏è ***IMPORTANT***: *Model3DView* is still in very early stages of development. The API is not final and ~~may~~ will change over the course of upcoming version releases.

## Installation üõ†
In Xcode add the dependency to your project via *File > Add Packages > Search or Enter Package URL* and use the following url:
```
https://github.com/frzi/Model3DView.git
```

Once added, import the package in your code:
```swift
import Model3DView
```

<br>

## Features ‚ú®

* **glTF support!**  
  *Model3DView* supports loading and rendering glTF models right out of the box.

* **Skyboxes and IBL (image based lighting)**  
  Does your model use PBR materials? Change the global lighting by setting an IBL image. (*OpenEXR files supported!*)

* **Interactive camera controls**  
  Let users interact with your model by moving the camera. *Model3DView* comes with *OrbitControls* (aka arcball) that will take care of this.

## Quickstart üöÄ
The code is provided with ample documentation. For detailed information about views, methods, etc, please see inquire Xcode's documentation features. Below a quick rundown of *Model3DView*'s features.

Using *Model3DView* couldn't possibly be more easy. Use the `Model3DView` like any other view:
```swift
import Model3DView

struct MyView: View {
	var body: some View {
		Model3DView(named: "duck.gltf")
	}
}
```
This renders a 3D model with the filename "*duck.gltf*" that's located in the app's bundle.

### `Model3DView`

#### Transform
#### `onLoad` handler

### Cameras

### Interactive cameras

### Skyboxes and IBL (image based lighting)

## FAQ üìë
### Can I use this to make 3D games?
***No***. It is very important to understand *Model3DView* is made to only render 3D models in your SwiftUI app, with very limited interaction. It's nothing more than an 'ImageView' to easily spruce up your app with 3D graphics.

### Why use *Model3DView* instead of *SceneView*?  
*SceneView* (included with SwiftUI) is very limited in its nature. It simply wraps a `SKSceneView` for SwiftUI. But due to it being closed source gives no control on this view. For instance: giving the view a transparent background is practically impossible. 

*Model3DView* also provides a workflow more inline with SwiftUI's ecosystem; using view modifiers to manipulate the model and camera.

<br>

## Known issues üí¢
* Animating cameras using SwiftUI's animation model is still very wonky.
* Bad error handling when a model fails to load.

## Thanks üôá
* [GLTFSceneKit](https://github.com/magicien/GLTFSceneKit) - This project wouldn't be half as interesting if it didn't have glTF support.
* [DisplayLink](https://github.com/timdonnelly/DisplayLink) - A wrapper around `DisplayLink` for SwiftUI.
